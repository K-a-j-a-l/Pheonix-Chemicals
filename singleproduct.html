                    <p>
                        PU TopCoat is a high performance, ready to use, cold applied, single component, elastomeric high build liquid waterproofing membrane, based on Aliphatic Polyurethane modified bitumen emulsion. PU TopCoat forms a seamless, highly elastic and durable film
                        that adheres well to most of the common substrates e.g. concrete, cement blocks, wood, existing roof felts. PU TopCoat is highly resistant to chlorides and sulphates commonly present in the soil. It is also highly UV resistant.

                    <h1>ElastoWhite</h1>
                    <p>
                        ElastoWhite is a special synthetic resin based waterproof coating. Because of its excellent flexibility and thixotropic nature, it is ideal for use on vertical as well as horizontal surfaces. It is single pack, very economical and pollution free waterproof
                        coating. Due to its white color, it offers excellent UV Resistance & Solar reflectivity. Gives cooling effect due to the reflective properties.

                    <h4>Principal Application</h4>
                    <p>
                        Waterproofing for roofs ranging from asphalt, asbestos, cement to concrete and terrazzo tiles. Recommended for both horizontal and inclined structures, waterproofing of roof slabs, terraces, balconies, sun shades, parapet walls, etc. provides additional
                        waterproofing and protection when used as base or intermediate coat in brickbat coba / ISP flooring. Waterproofing of new as well as old surfaces waterproofing membrane for FLAT ROOFING SYSTEM (Traditional and Inversed).
                    </p>
                    <h4>Substrates</h4>
                    <h5>Nature of substrates</h5>
                    <p>
                        ElastoWhite waterproof membranes can be applied not only to concrete but also to wood and metal surfaces. With the latter a special primer is necessary.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Roof Pitches</h5>
                    <p>
                        the membrane can be applied for all roofs to any extent of slope. Conditions of substrate: Concrete and cementations substrate are to be well compacted and at least 28 days old, with toweled finish. Wood panels or metal sheeting should be solidly fixed
                        and cleaned. All surfaces must be clean, dry and free from dust or rust and oil residue.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Coverage</h4>
                    <p>
                        Coverage depends upon the nature of the surface to be applied. But on average, smooth surface will give approx. 30 Sq Ft per kg (First Coat) & 35 Sq Ft per Kg (Second Coat). Two coats of the product will give 300 microns dft.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Mechanical Protection</h4>
                    <h5>Roofs not subject to traffic</h5>
                    <p>
                        Fine mesh nylon sheet should be placed over the insulation before covering with washed gravel (15/30mm gauge) to a minimal thickness of 5cm. Where the thickness of the insulation is more than 5cm. Apply gravel to the same thickness as the insulation.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Roofs subject to traffic</h5>
                    <p>
                        Protection by prefabricated concrete slabs, using wedges made from small squares of ROOFMATE 20x20 cm to adjust levels and allow rain water to drain under protection. Protection by in-situ concrete screed: a ‘KRAFT’ paper protection should be placed over
                        the insulation and topped with a concrete screed of 4 to 5 cm. thickness.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Health & Safety</h4>
                    <p>
                        As with all chemicals, caution should always be exercised. Protective clothing such as gloves and goggles should be worn.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Inhalation</h5>
                    <p>
                        nhalation of vapor or mist should be avoided. If inhaled symptoms include coughing, wheezing, laryngitis, and shortness of breath, headache, nausea, and vomiting. Immediately shift victim to fresh air, if needed immediately start artificial respiration.
                        Give oxygen if breathing is labored. Get emergency medical help.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Eye Contact</h5>
                    <p>
                        Flush eyes with water for 15 minutes and call for medical help.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Ingestion</h5>
                    <p>
                        Cause nausea, vomiting and loss of consciousness. If accidentally swallowed do not induce vomiting rather call for medical help immediately.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Skin Contact</h5>
                    <p>
                        Flush with water or soap and water till all traces have been removed. Seek medical attention if required.

                    <p>
                        PUInjectGrout is a low viscous, single Component, hydrophobic, MDI-based, polyurethane injection resin without catalyst. It only reacts with water and forms a Flexible Polyurethane Foam. This product can be injected pure directly into a leaking crack,
                        fracture or joint. After injection has taken place, the chemical will expand and fill the void forming a tight, impermeable elastomeric seal and stops the water flow.

                    <h4>Advantages</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><i class="fa fa-caret-right"></i>1-component. No catalyst required.</li>
                        <li><i class="fa fa-caret-right"></i>Immediate increase of viscosity is ideal for active leaks.</li>

                    <h4>Application</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><i class="fa fa-caret-right"></i>Start the injection at the first packer, for vertical joints or cracks this is usually the lowest packer.</li>
                        <li><i class="fa fa-caret-right"></i>Do not over pressurize while injecting; the correct injection pressure is the pressure that allows to resin to flow into the crack or joint. Avoid injecting at pressure of more than 1500psi (100bar).</li>
                        <li><i class="fa fa-caret-right"></i>If unreacted resin comes out of the joint or crack, stop the injection and move on to the next packer.</li>
                        <li><i class="fa fa-caret-right"></i>After the last injection of resin into the packer, shoot a little bit of water into the packer in order to make sure that the last injected resin will react as well.</li>
                        <li><i class="fa fa-caret-right"></i>Only catalyse the resin you will use within the next few hours.</li>
                        <li><i class="fa fa-caret-right"></i>Always flush the pump out at the end of the day. Resin left in the pump overnight can damage the pump.</li>

                    <h4>Application Procedure</h4>
                    <p>After preparing the surface for waterproofing treatment</p>
                    <p><strong>Priming: </strong>Dilute the ElastoBlack with 20% water and apply a thin coat as primer.</p>
                    <p><strong>Cracks: </strong> All shrinkage and non-structural cracks must be treated with not less than 1mm coat.</p>
                    <p><strong>Application: </strong>ElastoBlack should be applied by brush to obtain a continuous unbroken film. 2 coats are required with the second coat applied at right angle after the first coat has cured. </p>
                    <p>
                        ElastoBlack must be protected from mechanical damages during subsequent construction or backfilling work. Any damage may be repaired by spot application. If a water ponding test is to be conducted, the membrane should be cured for a minimum 48 – 72 hrs.
                        ElastoBlack is resistant to frost, adhesion with be impaired if applied to frosted substrates. Application should be avoided if substrate temperature is below 50C or rain is imminent.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Storage</h4>
                    <p>
                        Store between temperature of 5&deg;C and 40&deg;C. Keep containers closed when not in use.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Shelf-life</h4>
                    <p>
                        18 Months from date of manufacturing provided stored under shade, away from direct heat and sunlight and well protected from freezing.
